Project Topic Area: Analyzing, visualizing and making predictions on data. Data will be from the publicly availble Cincinnati Crime data from the past 10 years. I will clean up this data and put it into a SQL database and table. This data can then be analyzed in different ways to figure out new insights. I will then use the program mapbox to create a heatmap of this data, multiple maps or tables can be made based on needs. I want to ensure that the average consumer of this project can see and gain value from what I create. AI/ML is also a consideration to be used on the data in order to make predictions of crimes for example.
