Appendix of Senior Design Project: Cincinnati Crime Data Analysis and Visualization

Author: Ted Cordonnier


This markdown aims to document the meetings and hours that I have done over the semester to get a better understanding of what progress I have made

Lots of the time that I have used this semester has been towards the many assignments that have been given. There has been something around 8-10 assignments 
that have been completed. These assignments have done a great job at helping me get my whole project organized and professional. It has also helped with 
keeping me being held responsible for making progress towards my project each week. 


Meetings with the Professor:

I chose Seokki Lee because he is currently my professor for my database class and my project has many similarities to that field of study.
It was also coincidental that he is working on some projects that are similar to what I am doing so it is a good learning experience for both of us.
I will admit that I got him as my advisor later in the Semester because of not fully understanding the process but now all things have been sorted out with no problems.
We have met a couple of times to discuss the direction that I want to take the project. I had a few questions about whether or not I should add certain things to the
list of what I am adding to my project. 
Overall, we have had good conversations and understanding about where I want to go with the project. I fully expect in the future that we will have meetings about 
the specific implementation of how I am doing things, and we will both be able to learn new things and create a solid project.
