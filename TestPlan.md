# Test Plan

## Project: Statistical Correlation Analysis and Automation Program

## Part I. Description of Overall Test Plan

The test plan for the Automated Correlation Analysis project encompasses a comprehensive approach to ensure the program's functionality, performance, and reliability. Testing strategies include unit tests to validate the correctness of correlation computations, integration tests to ensure correct interaction between the program's components, and performance tests to assess the tool with varying datasets.
